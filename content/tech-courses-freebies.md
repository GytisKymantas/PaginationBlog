To help you make the most of your time, I have curated a list of premium video courses that have gone completely free temporarily during the Coronavirus crisis.

1. Pluralsight is among the world’s best online training platforms producing video screencasts around software development, machine learning and new technologies that are in demand. They have made their entire library free for the month of April and you don’t even need a credit card to register an account. [Learn more](https://www.pluralsight.com/offer/2020/free-april-month).

2. I am a fan of [Udemy](/internet/buying-udemy-courses/31851/) and some of the programming skills I have learned in through recent years are through Udemy. The courses are inexpensive and the teachers that have high-rating are actually very good. Udemy just made over 180 top courses for beginners free and these aren’t just limited to tech.
