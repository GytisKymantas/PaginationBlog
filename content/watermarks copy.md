Microsoft Word includes a useful "Insert Watermark" feature to help you easily add your brand's logo image or a text stamp that fades behind the content of every page in the document. A company's policy may require employees to add watermarks to indicate if any document is in draft stage or if the document is confidential and not meant for external distribution.

## Insert Watermarks in Google Docs

Unlike Microsoft Word, there's no built-in support for Watermarks in Google Docs but there's a simple workaround - create a faded image with the text of your watermark and place that image behind the text of your document pages. Here's how:

### 1. Create the watermark stamp

Launch MS Paint on your computer and create a simple watermark image in landscape mode with dark gray text. Please use a bold font like Impact with large font size as the large image can always be resized inside Google Docs but not vice-versa.

I've also added some ready-to-use image stamps on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEfk4GVHZc/RPbG0BG17J8J_pk5UCEksg/view?utm_content=DAEfk4GVHZc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink) and [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/2NrjQFp).

### 2. Upload Watermark to Google Docs

Inside Google Docs, go to the Insert menu, choose the Image submenu and select `Upload from Computer`. Upload the watermark image that you saved in the previous step to Google Docs.

### 3. Open Image Options

Right-click the uploaded image inside Google Docs and choose `Image Options` from the contextual menu.

### 4. Change Rotation

Expand the Image Options sidebar and, under the
`Size & Rotation` section, set the
angle to around 320&deg; to make the watermark diagonal.

### 5. Send the Image Behind Text

- Under the text wrapping section, choose `Behind Text` to send the watermark image behind the content of your document.
- Under Position, choose the `Fixed position` option with the layout set as `Center`. This will position your watermark image right in the center of the page.
- Under the Adjustments section, set the transparency level to around 80% to fade the watermark image in the background.

#### The Watermark Effect in Documents

Here's how the [final watermark](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QjxOaSJN0SL8tapuBwIxzwF08oDCBQvM0Ho_pk8V98c/edit?usp=sharing) effect will look like in your Google Document.

**Tip:** You can use [Document Studio](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/document_studio/429444628321) to generate [PDF files from Google Forms](/generate-pdf-files-from-google-forms-6324) and the watermarks would be also show up in your PDF document.
