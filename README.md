# Next.js + Tailwind + Markdown + MDX

> Work in Progress

## Things to do

This is a work in progress. Here are some things to do:

- The homepage should display a list of 10 most recent posts with pagination
- There should be a /topic page that displays a list of tags and their count
- There should be a /topic/:topic page that displays a list of posts that have the topic with pagination like /topic/tag1/page/2
- The post page is handled by /app/[...slug]/page.js and it seems to be working well.
- Should be able to handle both MD and MDX files
